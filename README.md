# Email_Spam_Detection
Introduction
This project involves creating a machine learning model to detect spam emails. The model is trained on a dataset of labeled emails (spam and ham) and uses various natural language processing (NLP) techniques to classify incoming emails as either spam or non-spam.

Features
Preprocessing: Tokenization, stop words removal, stemming/lemmatization.
Vectorization: TF-IDF vectorizer to convert text data into numerical features.
Modeling: Trained using various machine learning algorithms like Naive Bayes, SVM, and Logistic Regression.
